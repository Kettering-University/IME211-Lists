# Integrated Example: Product Inventory Analysis with Lists

# As an industrial engineer, you are tasked with analyzing and updating the inventory of products based on their stock levels.
# The inventory data is represented as a list of lists, where each inner list contains a product code and its stock level.

# Given Data:
# Initial inventory data: A list of lists with each inner list containing a product code and its stock level.
inventory = [["P1", 120], ["P2", 80], ["P3", 150], ["P4", 30], ["P5", 200]]

# Identify products with stock levels below 100 units and print their product codes.# Your code here:


# Increase stock by 100 units for products with low stock, using list comprehension.

# Identify and list products that now have a stock level of more than 200 units after restocking.


# Calculate the average stock level of all products after the restocking.
